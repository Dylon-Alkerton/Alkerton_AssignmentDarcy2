The technologies that I used were jade for my html and sass for my styles. I used these mainly becuase they were the projects requirements. I found that jade was very simple to use and helped with making less syntax errors. Getting use to sass took a little more work, even though the simple syntax does help.  


P.s Had to change the file name from alkerton_assignment2 to alkerton_DarcyAssignment2 because I had a project already in github by the name, incase it is broken.
